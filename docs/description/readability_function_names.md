Function and macro names are always written in snake_case in Elixir.

    # snake_case

    def handle_incoming_message(message) do
    end

    # not snake_case

    def handleIncomingMessage(message) do
    end

Like all `Readability` issues, this one is not a technical concern.
But you can improve the odds of others reading and liking your code by making
it easier to follow.
